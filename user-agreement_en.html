    <h2>1. Scope and Confirmation</h2>
    <p>This agreement helps you understand the Moodex services we provide and your rights and obligations when using them. Due to the rapid development of the Internet, the terms listed here may not cover all rights and obligations between you and us, and existing provisions may not fully meet future development needs. Therefore, legal notices, service rules, and other content are considered supplementary agreements and have the same legal effect.</p>
    <p>To further improve the user experience, we will continuously update our services, providing version upgrades, functional updates, and rule changes. This agreement may be updated accordingly. We will notify you of updates via announcements or in-app messages ("Notifications"). Updates will take effect on the date specified in the notification.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for safeguarding your account and password and are legally responsible for all activities under your account. Any risk, liability, loss, or expense arising from the unauthorized or illegal use of your account and password due to your own reasons shall be borne by you.</p>
